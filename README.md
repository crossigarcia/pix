# Pix

An application built primarily for my better understanding of the differences between a React functional and class component. It allows the user to get search for images by kewyword. 


## Usage 

* When the page loads the user is presented with a search bar, a image qty slider and a grid of images (as well as navigation that only switches the type of component used in react, functionality remains the same). 
* When a user types into the search bar it will start bringing up images based on the input.
* Moving the slider will change the qty of images displayed in the grid. 
* If a user clicks on an image it will open a modal with a larger version of the image and a link to go to a site to download the image from.

## Technologies Used

* React
